# Chanakya ✍️
Chanakya will document my journey to understand, analyze, make visuals for, and train a model on the UCI 'Audit Data' dataset.

Current Goals:
* Identify **warning signs** and risk factors for fraud or suspicious activity
* Gain an **understanding** of such warning signs
* Train a model to **classify firms** as suspicious or not, given their data

Notice: PCA for investigating the importance of each feature is now being modified, due to misguided analysis in the last update.

The next update will correct for this. Stay tuned.
