# Chanakya ‚úçÔ∏è

Chanakya will document my journey to understand, analyze, visualize, and train a model on the UCI 'Audit Data' dataset.

## Initial Goals:
- Identify **warning signs** and risk factors for fraud or suspicious activity.
- Gain an **understanding** of such warning signs.
- Train a model to **classify firms** as suspicious or not, based on their data.

## Completed Goals:

- **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded in data using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks
   - Investigated the structure and nature of audit_risk.csv (dataframe 'ad') and trail.csv (dataframe 'td') using Python, Pandas, and MatplotLib

- **Model Development:**
   - Built **Logistic Regression models** to classify firms as suspicious (Risk = 1) or not suspicious (Risk = 0).
   - Standardized numerical data to **improve model performance**
   - Implemented **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the number of features and improve model interpretability.

- **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the model's performance using **Accuracy** and **F1 score**.
   - Benchmarked the model both **before and after applying PCA** to assess dimensionality reduction benefits.

## Future Goals ü§î:
- Experiment with other classification algorithms (e.g., **Random Forest**, **Bagging**) to compare performance.
- Tune model hyperparameters for **optimal performance**.
- Investigate other feature engineering techniques to enhance model predictions.
